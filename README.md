### Update
So I've done a few updates to this project after abandoning it. Though as of this commit, I am most likely done with being a developer all together. Maybe oneday I'll return to add some new features & clean up things.

This site is no longer maintained. The site uses PhalconPHP for it's framework. Also makes use of phpredis for caching. The code is very poorly done, I never really had much passion for this site so I just slapped it together as quickly as possible.
